MyTopix | Personal Message Board - Change Log
=============================================

Version: 1.3.0
- November 09, 2006

1. Moved database connection info to a seperate file. They are now stored as constants.

Version: 1.2.3
- January 04, 2005

1.  Modified 'index.php' to include instructions on how to use the integration feature
    of MyTopix. I simplified the process a little bit and made it easier to understand.
2.  I added a debug mode that can be accessed within any page by adding '&debug' to the
    end of the URI. Currently it only spits out an array at the bottom of the current
    page within queries and their execution times. It will expand in time.
3.  Fixed an issue that wouldn't save certain data when adding a forum within the ACP.
4.  Got rid of that 'blah' thingy when viewing the moderator management features within
    the ACP.
5.  Added several improvements to template browsing. Check boxes have been moved to the 
    left, next to the names of the templates. The template names are also labels for the
    check boxes. Within the section list I made the names of the sections into links so
    it would be easier to follow.
6.  Added several new options to the ACP's config area. Mainly dealing with the image
    tag resizer. I forgot to add those options that let you activate / deactive the 
    feature as well as adding your own size limits to images.
7.  Modified the form handler for the ACP so ALL check box labels are titles for the
    checkboxes.
8.  Modified a few language files and fixed some spelling errors.
9.  Rewrote the entire database abstraction library from scratch to ensure efficiency,
    a better overall structure, commenting, optmizations and bug fixing.
10. Fixed a few 'issues' with the parse handler
11. Fixed an attachment issue within the form handler.
12. Added a few new options to the user handler as well as some squashed bugs.
13. The master handler has been recommented.
14. The event handler has been recommented.
15. Modified the emoticon system within the parse handler and smilie box display.
16. Fixed that title issue within the notes module.
17. Recommented and optimized the logon module a bit.
18. Fixed that editing permission issue within the post module.
19. Total rehaul of the installer system to accomodate the new upgrade manager.
21. Fixed that irritating space issue within the bot listing.
22. Made a few extra emoticons and published a GDK for them.
23. Also added a few more default avatars to the system.
24. Added a few other bits and bobs here and there.
